Challenge
Create the following application using MERN Stack
Backend
Create a backend sever application which implements basic JWT authentication
1.	You must use Express.js library
2.	We will be looking for well organized, maintainable code. 
3.	Use MVC Architecture.
4.	You should use a ODM like mongoose to connect with MongoDb
5.	The backend should be reasonably secure.
6.	Endpoints:- Login, Signup, Logout, GetUser
Frontend
Create a Frontend application in React and integrate it with your backend application.
1.	Designs for Login and Signup pages: https://www.figma.com/file/RzmsZs8CPUiVacfLdb2C0h/Sign-In-(Community)?node-id=7%3A1833
2.	You need not implement Oauth.
3.	Create one more page which displays logged in userâ€™s full name with a logout button and the page should only be visible to authenticated user.
4.	Create one more page with logout button which is only visible once logged in.
5.	You can use any known frontend libraries.
6.	The authentication state should be persistent, meaning user should stay logged in even after reopening the browser.
7.	Again, well organized, maintainable code is important. 
8.	Bonus: Implement proper form validation.

And finally host both of your applications on Heroku, Netlify or any platform of your choice.
